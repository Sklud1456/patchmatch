#### The score for the presentation of statistics

It can be considered from the following aspects: whether the displayed information has a good summary of the overall code repository, and whether the users who have just known the project can have a preliminary understanding of the vulnerabilities and patches of the project from a macro perspective; Whether the presentation of statistical information is comprehensive.

```
The Scoring Example of whether the information presented provides a good overview of the overall project:
1 to 3 points: Not good, it's just a bunch of irrelevant information. 
4 to 5 points: So-so, missing a bit of information. 
6 to 8 points: It's OK. It paints the basic picture of the project.
9 to 10 points: Very good, for people who are new to the program to get a right sense of the safety of the program right away.
```
```
The Scoring Example of whether the generalization of CVE and commit information is scored comprehensively:
1 to 3 points: It's not comprehensive. It's just a bunch of irrelevant information. 
4 to 5 points: So-so, missing a bit of information. 
6 to 8 points: It's OK. The user has a general understanding of CVE and commit. 
9 to 10 points: Very good. Not only did I get the information I wanted, but I also got some useful information that I didn't expect. 
```

```
The Scoring Example of whether the presentation of statistical information is comprehensive:
1 to 3 points: It's not comprehensive. None of the information I wanted was presented. 
4 to 5 points: So-so, missing a bit of information. 
6 to 8 points: It's OK. Most of the information I want is covered here. 
9 to 10 points: Very good. Not only did I get the information I wanted, but I also got some useful information that I didn't expect. 
```

#### The score for management information

It can be considered from the following aspects: whether the information displayed on the list page is comprehensive; whether the operation interaction of adding, modifying and searching is reasonable and in line with the operation intuition; is it helpful for you to manage this information?

```
The Scoring Example of whether the information displayed on the list page is comprehensive:
1 to 3 points: Not good, it's just a bunch of irrelevant information.
4 to 5 points: So-so, missing a bit of information. 
6 to 8 points: It's OK. It can picture the basic status of the commit or CVE.
9 to 10 points: Very good. Not only did I get the information I wanted, but I also got some useful information that I didn't expect.
```
```
The Scoring Example of whether the operation interaction of adding, modifying and searching is reasonable:
1 to 3 points: Not good, it's very weird to operate. 
4 to 5 points: So-so, the operation barely works. 
6 to 8 points: It's OK. It's very comfortable to use. 
9 to 10 points: Very good. It is very much in line with my operating habits.
```
```
The Scoring Example of whether this visual interface will help you manage this information:
1 to 3 points: Not good, it would just be gilding the lily.
4 to 5 points: So-so, it can eliminate some of the work for me. 
6 to 8 points: It's OK. It allows me to manage information better. 
9 to 10 points: Very good. The visual interface makes up for many unaccustomed aspects of daily work.
```

#### The score for the application of the model

It can be considered from the following perspectives: compared to your previous way of finding patches, whether it is more humane; whether it is faster.
```
The Scoring Example of whether it is more humane when compared to your previous way of finding patches:
1 to 3 points: Not good, it's not as good as what we used before. 
4 to 5 points: So-so, it can eliminate some of the work for me. 
6 to 8 points: It's OK. I'll try to use it at work. 
9 to 10 points: Very good. I can't wait to replace my previous job with this method.
```
```
The Scoring Example of whether it is faster when compared to your previous way of finding patches:
1 to 3 points: Not good, it's not as good as what we used before. 
4 to 5 points: So-so, it'll take a little less time. 
6 to 8 points: It's OK. It's a lot faster, but there's a slight flaw. 
9 to 10 points: Very good. Very fast, flaws outweigh the flaws, looking forward to the real use in the work.
```
```
The Scoring Example of whether the interaction with the model application interface is reasonable:
1 to 3 points: Not good, incomplete information, poor interaction. 
4 to 5 points: So-so, barely able to use. 
6 to 8 points: It's OK. It follows the normal logic of use.

9 to 10 points: Very good. It's very smooth to use, and the information can be presented in a way that suits my usage habits
```

#### The score for the overall use

The overall feeling of use

```
The Scoring Example of this visual interface helps you with your overall work:
1 to 3 points: Not good, it is not as good as what we did before.
4 to 5 points: So-so, it can eliminate some of the work for me.
6 to 8 points: It's OK. Allows me to better manage information and find patches.
9 to 10 points: Very good. The visual interface makes up for many unaccustomed aspects of daily work, but also facilitates the search for patches.

#### Some feedback suggestions:

U1(The developer in the field of server security): I am used to using the command line a lot, so I don't like the visual interface very much. The model is interesting and useful but the application of the model can be further developed, and the management function is better connected to GitHub, rather than restricted to the local environment.

U3: Consider more attempts on the model side.

U7: You can show more information about commit statistics.

U8: The UI needs to be optimized.

U12: The interaction side can consider more functionality.
